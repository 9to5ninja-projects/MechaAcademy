# Development Workflow with Copilot

## Comment-Driven Development Pattern

### Effective Copilot Prompts
```javascript
// Create a medium assault frame that:
// - Has balanced armor and speed (120 armor, 100 speed)
// - Specializes in energy weapons (energy efficiency bonus)
// - Has 4 weapon hardpoints but limited support slots
// - Unlocks after "Advanced Combat Theory" course

// Generate 5 cooling system parts that:
// - Reduce heat generation by 10-30%
// - Have weight costs of 3-8 units
// - Include passive heat dissipation bonuses
// - Scale from common to legendary rarity

Development Process

Write descriptive comments about what you want to create
Let Copilot generate the implementation
Test the generated code in RPG Maker MZ
Iterate and refine using additional comments
Document successful patterns for future use

Testing Workflow

Create content using Copilot suggestions
Validate data using development tools
Test in game using RPG Maker MZ playtest
Check balance using automated testing tools
Refine based on results
